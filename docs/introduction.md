# Introduction

UI components library in the new neomorphism design style

## Overview

The neomorphism is a new design trend applied to UI/UX. You can form this effect, by adding two shadows to your flat-designed elements, one is a light shadow from the top left of the element, and the other is a dark shadow towards the bottom right. the combination of both creates the effect of the elements pushing themselves through your display.

## Installation

You can access this library from NPM, and include into your awesome project

```bash
# npm
npm install --save neomorphism

# yarn
yarn add neomorphism
```

## import css file

```js
import 'neomorphism/dist/neomorphism.css';
```

> Without this css file you can't use `neomorphism` on your project.

## Use CDNs

If you want a quick start, Copy-paste the stylesheet `<link>` into your `<head>` before all other stylesheets to load our CSS.

```html
<link type="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/neomorphism" />
```
